# Rust MAX44009 Ambient Light Sensor [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/max44009.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/max44009) [![Docs](https://docs.rs/max44009/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/max44009) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eldruin/max44009-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eldruin/max44009-rs)

This is a platform agnostic Rust driver for the MAX44009 ambient
light sensor, based on the
[`embedded-hal`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal) traits.

This driver allows you to:
- Read lux measurement.
- Set the measurement mode.
- Set the configuration mode.
- Set the integration time.
- Set the current division ratio.
- Read the integration time.
- Read the current division ratio.
- Enable/disable interrupt generation.
- Check if an interrupt has happened.

## The device
The MAX44009 ambient light sensor features an I2C digital output
that is ideal for a number of portable applications such as
smartphones, notebooks, and industrial sensors.
At less than 1Î¼A operating current, it is the lowest power ambient
light sensor in the industry and features an ultra-wide 22-bit
dynamic range from 0.045 lux to 188,000 lux.
Low-light operation allows easy operation in dark-glass
applications.
The on-chip photodiode's spectral response is optimized to mimic
the human eye's perception of ambient light and incorporates
IR and UV blocking capability. The adaptive gain block
automatically selects the correct lux range to optimize the
counts/lux.
